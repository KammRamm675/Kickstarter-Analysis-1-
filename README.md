# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
    
### Purpose

-   The purpose of this analysis is to provide information on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and how similar campaigns fared in relation to their respective launch dates and funding goals. 
    
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-   A challenge that was to be expected when creating the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date is the conjugation of formulas used.  Please reference this link, https://github.com/KammRamm675/Kickstarter-Analysis-1-/blob/main/Resources%20Folder/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png.  The analysis performed on the outcomes based on the launch was one that required a narrowing of information.  The entire dataset was not used but mainly focused on the Parent Category of "theater."  To further screen the dataset, we considered ALL of the years in the data as well as only the campaigns that were successful, failed, and cancelled.  

-   Concerning challenges, the only challenges would be the appropriate recording of dates and the accuracy at which they are obtained.  As we see for the month October and cancellations, there wasn't any data present.  This could be from inaccurate recordings.   
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-   Please reference, https://github.com/KammRamm675/Kickstarter-Analysis-1-/blob/main/Resources%20Folder/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png.  As with the analysis of the outcomes based on the launch date of campaigns the entire dataset was not used.  Rather, the columns for "outcome" were used.  This was further filtered to incorporate the "goal amount" column and the "subcategory" column. As opposed to the analysis of outcomes by launch date, the filter "plays" was applied.  

-   Concerning challenges included accuracy of the formulas used in each goal range.  Proper conjugation between each range's formula MUST be observed to obtain proper reflection of data. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-   One of the most challenging aspects of this tracker was the development of the tables in the report.  To be accurate in their displaying of critical (and accurate) expression of information requestion there is a mandatory amount of time triple checking formulas for their accuracy.  Another challenge was making sure the table generated also was labeled appropriately so that there are no assumptions to the information.   

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-   Please reference graph, "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch."  We can see a relation for Theater Outcomes based off the relationship between the number of outcomes throughout the year for the "successful," "failed," and "cancelled" values.  April and July are good times to start funding raise and December is the worst; in overall terms, the best dates to launch a campaign would be in May.  If you look at the numbers May has 111 successes, 52 failures, and 3 cancellations.  Keeping an eye on success, there is a total of 56 successes overall (Successes-(failed+canceled).  Using the same process, we can see that December is the worst month with a -1 campaign success total.  October will be considered inconclusive due to there being no data present.)  

-   Another item to note is throughout the year, a steady line was maintained for campaigns being cancelled canceled. January was the only spike with most cancellations and July had the least cancellations with only 1. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals

-   Please reference graph, "Outcomes Based on Goals?  One of the biggest conclusions that can be drawn from this graph is the from the cancellation line.  At every range of goals there were NO Outcomes resulting from cancellations.  Every range maintained a 0% cancellation degree. 

-   The second conclusion that can be drawn from this graph the mirror image generated between the "successful" and "failed" percentages.  Probably the most unique ranges would be $15,000-$19,999 and the $45,000-$49,999.  The $15,000-$19,999 range held an even pass/fail campaign outcome with both being 50%.  The $45,000-$49,999 range experienced every campaign fail.  A 100% fail rate. 

### Limitations of Dataset

-   One of the limitations that datasets like these can face is incomplete work.  In the case of creating the graph for "Outcomes Based on Launch Dates," for example, the month of October didn't register at all on the graph.  This could be from a true reflection of data not available, or a typo made when inputting said data.  

-   Another limitation faced in this type of data is quality of data.  For example, in the graph "Outcomes Based on Goal," there are many goal ranges.  It could be easy to smudge on the actual amount of money made and reported by each campaign.  Which, depending on how big teh smudge is could result in more dramatic results. 


### Other Considerations

-   This analysis used line graphs exclusively mostly.  I would have used a histogram for the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date." Histograms reflect numerical distrubution.  

-   The line graph for "Outcomes Based on Goals" is very appropriate for that type of data and I wouldn't change it.  If I had to change it would go with a bar graph.
